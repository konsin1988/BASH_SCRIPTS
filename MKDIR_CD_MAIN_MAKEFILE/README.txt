/* The script creates a directory (if it doesn't exist), 
/* creates a main.c, in_param.c, print_help.c, README.txt,
/* std.c, std.h, name.c, name.h (name - name of the program) 
/* and a Makefile in it with some initial code. 
/* Then it opens a second terminal window for working 
/* in this derrictory, open README.txt for starting to work 
/* with new project (very useful for those who are used 
/* to working from two windows in parallel). 
/* Next, it opens main.c in the vim editor.
/* If the directory existed, the script generates an error. 
/* If there are not enough parameters, the script 
/* generates an error. There is a helper function --help.
